                        Like yourself, we work in the hair and beauty industry. We have worked with all
                        the big names and we have seen a substantial amount of change in the way the
                        industry works, over recent years. There is little respect given to professional
                        products any more and I’m sure you’ll agree, times are tougher now than they
                        have ever been. We have to contend with online prices, products with no
                        restrictions on professional only sale and there is little left for hair salons. The
                        product ranges have become so big they are almost unaffordable to stock and
                        the salon support just isn’t there as much now. Fortunately I had the opportunity
                        to meet Juan, he owns a laboratory in the USA and he has to be one of the most
                        knowledgeable and helpful people I’ve ever met. He introduced me to the
                        chemistry of hair care and the ethics that they put in their high quality
                        formulations. True professional products, made without any compromise on
                        ingredients and formulated to create true professional results. Together, with Juan
                        we came up with the concept of offering these products directly to salons, under
                        their own salon brand. Products the stylists can trust and confidently recommend
                        to their clients. The same ability to create formulas that the big brands have, but
                        now available to every professional.
